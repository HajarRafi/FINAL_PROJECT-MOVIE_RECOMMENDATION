# FINAL_PROJECT-MOVIE_RECOMMENDATION
Final Bootcamp Project done by [Aysel Rasulova](https://github.com/ayselrasul) and [Hajar Rafibayli](https://github.com/HajarRafi).

The objectives are to build a Movie Recommendation system using Content-based and Collaborative filtration strategies and create some interactive visualizations to present data insights. For this purpose, such tools as Jupyter Notebook, Tableau Public, Streamlit and MySQL were used.
